AIVR2022 will bring together researchers and scientists, both industrial and academic, developing novel Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality outcome. Research in Virtual Reality (VR) is concerned with computing technologies that allow humans to see, hear, talk, think, learn, and solve problems in virtual and augmented environments. Research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) addresses technologies that allow computing machines to mimic these same human abilities. Although these two fields evolved separately, they share an interest in human senses, skills, and knowledge production. Thus, bringing them together will enable us to create more natural and realistic virtual worlds and develop better, more effective applications. Ultimately, this will lead to a future in which humans and humans, humans and machines, and machines and machines are interacting naturally in virtual worlds, with use cases and benefits we are only just beginning to imagine.

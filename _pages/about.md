I am a currently graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Chicago. I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Psychology at New York University (2022). Under my undergraduate research advisors Prof. Jean Claude Frachiiti, I centered around work in distributed system and data scheduling.

My current research interests include operating systems, machine learning and cloud computing. I joined the UCARE research group and was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Haryadi S. Gunawi. Lately, I’m working on improving storage for machine learning training workloads on GPUs. I try to find optimization solutions to improve GPU utilization in deep learning training and verify the effectiveness of solutions with both simulations and testbed evaluation. 

Previously, I have been working on sentiment analysis of the COVID-19 vaccine on Twitter. I try to analyze tweets to grasp the efficency of the vaccine from public opinion. Also, Proposing novel problem in distributed systems and developing scheduling algorithms and architectures to address them. Other areas of active interest include reinforcement learning with natural language and hierarchical reinforcement learning.

I am interested in cloud computing/distributed systems where my research focuses on improving the reliability, availability and scalability of cloud systems by detecting distributed concurrency bugs

Outside of research I spend my time playing sports with friends (🎿,⛰️,🏸,🏀,🏐,🏃), travelling, or reading books.

I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Chicago. I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Psychology at New York University (2022). Under my undergraduate research advisors Prof. Jean Claude Frachiiti, I centered around work in distributed system and data scheduling.

My current research interests include operating systems, machine learning and computer vision. Lately, I’m working on sentiment analysis of the COVID-19 vaccine on Twitter. I try to analyze tweets to grasp the efficency of the vaccine from public opinion. Previously, I have been proposing novel problem in distributed systems and developing scheduling algorithms and architectures to address them. Other areas of active interest include reinforcement learning with natural language and hierarchical reinforcement learning.

Outside of research I spend my time playing sports with friends (🎿,⛰️,🏸,🏀,🏐,🏃), travelling, or reading books.

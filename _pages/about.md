I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Chicago. I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Psychology at New York University (2022). Under my undergraduate research advisors Prof. Jean Claude Frachiiti, I centered around work in distributed system and data scheduling.

My current research interests include operating systems, machine learning and computer vision. Lately, I’m working on sentiment analysis of the COVID-19 vaccine on Twitter. I try to analyze public opinion to grasp the efficency of the vaccine. Previously, I have been proposing novel problem in distributed systems and developing scheduling algorithms and architectures to address them. Other areas of active interest include reinforcement learning with natural language and hierarchical reinforcement learning.

Knowledge transfer is a interesting and charming topic. If you are also interested in this, feel free to contact with me.
